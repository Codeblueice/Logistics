              <p>In the officers defense, assuming that the radar actually said 80mph. You got to realize how common it is that the person they stop will say,"it wasn't me", or. "I wasn't going that fast", on and on. </p>
			  
			  <p>So unless he's able to determine by your more detailed (but civil) reaction that it really is possible that you are not the guilty party. He's gonna make the assumption he got the right person.</p>
			  
			  <p>Don't be one of the guys (whether you are right or wrong, driving your car or a big truck) that talks back to the officer ignorantly with a nasty attitude. Right or wrong the officer is in the leveraged position and most of them are actually trying to do his job.</p>
			  
			 <p>They are not always right. But, they are also not always on a mission just to get you. The way you respond to his judgment call often will determine the outcome of the situation.  </p>
			 
			 <p>Oh yeah, and if it really was you, take the ticket and let it go. Suffer the consequences of your choices or get a lawyer or call TVC and stop being a cry baby cause you got caught! </p>

              <p>One of the requirements to operate full size trucks on the highways, and byways of this great land of ours, is being in possession of a valid Medical Certificate. These are acquired by undergoing a vigorous medical examination which can include, but is not limited to, very pointed suggestions about how to improve your overall health.</p>
			  
			  <p>Little changes in your daily routine, like keeping your heart rate at a constant 200 beats per minute for a few hours a day, may be suggested. Ways to achieve these goals with only subtle changes in daily activities, can range from hoisting manhole covers, to light mining. A sure way to disappoint your health care provider, is to tell him, or her, that you would be more comfortable just going for short little walks.</p>
				  
			  <p>There is no reason to commit to memory the calorie count of an apple peel, or to be able to rattle off the sodium content of tree bark. The most fundamental rule of thumb is, if you put it in your mouth, and you like it, spit it out, you are not supposed to be eating it. The doctor is a skilled professional, who feels a profound responsibility to be thorough, do not expect your diet training to be quite that brief. A special thing is added to your exam upon reaching 50 years old. </p>
			  
			  <p>When I was 49, after the exercise and diet portion of the exam was safely behind me, those happen every time for me by the way, we moved on to checking vision, hearing, and vital signs. At 50 when we finally reached this point, I noticed that while I reached for my jacket, the Doc was reaching for a rubber glove. He explained that at my age it was extremely important that I undergo a prostate exam. .</p>
			  
			  <p>For him, this may have been just another routine visit, but to me, it seemed like this should have been preceded by heavily administered anesthetic, and an enthusiastic test of The Emergency Broadcast System.</p>
			  
			  <p>Weeping did nothing to save me from this most intimate, and savage violation. When I was able to regain an upright position, a brief visual sweep of the office failed to detect the 3 and a half feet of galvanized pipe I expected to find. Trying to thread my arms into the sleeves of my jacket, while shaking like an apoplectic crack baby, proved more of a challenge than I was up to. I thought that a grown man crying, and dragging his jacket across the parking lot by one sleeve, would evoke pity, or at least interest in witnesses, but apparently the people I encountered had seen a 50 year old get his DOT physical before.p>
			  
			  <p>Is it just me, or would you agree that when you go and see the Doctor feeling great, you shouldn’t leave with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?</p>

              <p>Mr. Thomas, my fiancé just started truck driving and can have zero use of his phone, we talk when we can but it’s very short. </p>
			  
			  <p>Don’t get me wrong I am greatful for the times we do talk but I feel like it’s more about things that need to be fine other than checking up on one another, to hear each others voice or etc. </p>
			   
			  <p>How do I deal with not having communication with him as much as I used to, he’s my best friend so going from talking everyday to not talking at all or every few days is hard...  </p>
				
			  <p>I live in another state and we are trying to find a home base but it’s hard to take care of all of that when we can’t even talk to try and figure things out...  </p>
				 
			  <p>Help! I need it because I’m going crazy. </p>
				  
			  <p>Dear reader, remember that this training phase is just temporary Ja'Kari. Once he's done with training and has gone solo he can use his phone when hes not driving.</p>

              <p>"What truck should I buy?"  It's a great question before going owner operator.  Unfortunately, there no easy answer.  The first thing that you must consider is what you plan on doing with the truck?  What will you haul and where will you run?  How long will you keep it?</p>
			  
			  <p>When I first started trucking I asked that same question to everyone, including good diesel mechanics.  I will share with you what I learned from their answers and my experiences and some opinion of mechanics.</p>
				
			  <p>My basic response is that if you simply want to make the most money with the truck hauling regular freight, go Freightliner or International with Detroit or Cummings engine. Volvos would be next on my list with a Detroit, Cummings or Volvo Engine.  This opinion is based on lower cost of entry and maintenance.p>

			  <p>Is a trucking job at smaller or medium size trucking companies better than working at mega carriers?</p>
			  
			  <p>The likelihood of a smaller company being a better experience is higher if you're good at choosing a company, which is what you'll learn here..</p>
			  
			  <p>Why Mr. Thomas? Well, Mega carriers tend to lose track of the quality of people interacting with drivers.</p>

              <p>Questions:  Will autonomous truck take over and kill all trucking jobs?</p>
			  
			  <p> Answer:  I doubt it. Will they ever be used?  I'm sure in 10 years or more they'll be used just not the way people (news media and companies) like to run their stories and press releases.  They won't even replace 1/4 of truckers in 10 years</p>
			  
			  <p>Natural question:  How do you know?</p>
			  
			  <p>Answer:  lol, There's no way for me to prove it to you but I will repeat this and respond to it later.  Until then, let's get to the real about what is going on today and in the next 10 years.  Here is what's happening now....</p>
			  
			  <p>Trucking companies have increased pay and bonuses in 2017 and 2018.  Freight rates are up for the 1st and 2nd quarter in 2018 and this year is expected to be an even better year for the trucking industry.</p>
